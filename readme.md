# Natours App

RESTful API for a fictional tours company.
Built using modern technologies: node.js, express, mongoDB, mongoose and others.

Please read the [documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7311265/SWTBeJ7F?version=latest), it has thoroughly detailed examples and clear explanations on how to use this API.

Note: I worked on this project to learn Node.js and hence it is not original work.
